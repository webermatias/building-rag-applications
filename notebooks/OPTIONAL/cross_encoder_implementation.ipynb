    "# OPTIONAL: Implement ReRanker methods\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "For those looking for a deeper understanding of how CrossEncoders work, try implementing the two methods that power the CrossEncoder reranking system.  Once completed, compare your work with the implementation in the `reranker.py` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "1. Fill in the `None` sections in the `ReRanker Class`.  Read the comments for additional help.\n",
    "2. Test out your implementation on real search results and note how the scores are reranked.\n",
    "3. Compare your implementation with the code found in the `src/reranker.py` file."
