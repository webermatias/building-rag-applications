        "UF0nqolsNZc_99": "So let's talk about a clear set of examples where red light and near infrared light have been shown to have positive effects on our health. And these are the data that I referred to at the beginning of the episode from Dr. Glenn Jeffery at University College London, who again is a longstanding member of the neuroscience community working on visual neuroscience and who over the last decade or so has really emphasized the exploration of red light and near infrared light for restoration of neuronal function as we age. This is absolutely critical. We know that we don't accumulate many new brain cells as we get older. And in some areas of our nervous system, such as our neural retina, which is the part of our eye that's responsible for translating light information to electrical signals so that we can see, we don't get any new cells after the time in which we are born. So the ability to keep our neurons healthy is extremely important for our visual system, extremely important for our hippocampus, an area of the brain involved in memory. And I should just mention that even if people don't get Alzheimer's, there's always going to be some degree of age-related dementia.",
        "mcPSRWUYCv0_64": "I also think that the inflammation response is a healthy response. You have to keep it in check. And we're going to talk about specific practices for wound healing and injury in a moment. But this idea that just inflammation is bad and you want to reduce inflammation across the board, nothing could be further from the truth. We have pathways that exist in our body specifically to increase inflammation. It's the inflammation that goes unchecked, just like stress, which is problematic for repair from brain injury and that can exacerbate certain forms of dementia, et cetera. But I'd like to create a little bit more nuance or a lot more nuance if possible in the conversation around inflammation, because people have just taken this discussion around inflammation to be this idea that just inflammation is bad and nothing could be further from the truth. Before I continue, I just thought I'd answer a question that I get a lot, which is what about Wim Hof breathing? I get asked about this a lot. Wim Hof, also called AKA the Iceman, has this breathing that's similar to TUMO breathing, as it was originally called, involves basically hyperventilating and then doing some exhales and some breath holds.",
        "GLgKkG44MGo_74": "And maybe, should I talk a little bit about the role that oscillations may be playing in signal processing? Definitely, but before you do, I just want to ask you a intermediate question. We've talked a lot about inhalation, inspiration, and exhalation. What about breath holds? You know, in apnea, for instance, people are holding their breath, whether or not it's conscious or unconscious, they're holding their breath. What's known about breath holds in terms of how it might interact with brain state or oxygen, CO2? And I'm particularly interested in how breath holds with lungs empty versus breath holds with lungs full might differ in terms of their impact on the brain. I'm not aware of any studies on this, looking at a mechanistic level, but I find it really interesting. And even if there are no studies, I'd love it if you'd care to speculate. Well, one of the breath practices that intrigued me is where you basically hyperventilate for a minute and then hold your breath for as long as you can. TUMO style, Wim Hof style. We call it in the laboratory because frankly, before TUMO and before Wim, it was referred to as cyclic hyperventilation.",
        "K4Ze-Sp6aUE_44": "So if you look at people who lose weight and keep it off for a number of years, kind of outliers because most people don't keep it off for years, over 70% of them engage in regular exercise. Of people who do not keep weight loss, like maintain weight loss, less than 30% exercise regularly. So now that's just a correlation that doesn't necessarily prove causation. But there are some pretty compelling studies showing that exercise increases your sensitivity to satiety signals. So basically, you can have the same satiety signals, but you're more sensitive to them when you exercise. And there's actually a really classic study from the 1950s in Bengali workers, where they looked at basically four different quadrants of activity. So you had sedentary, lightly active, moderately active, heavily active, basically based on their job choice. And they didn't have an intervention. They just wanted to track them and see how much, you know, how many calories did they actually eat? So it was like a J-shaped curve. So the sedentary actually ate more food than the lightly active or moderately active. But from lightly active to heavily active, they almost perfectly compensated how many calories they should be eating.",
        "J7SrAEacyf8_48": "Now, earlier I said that estrogen is what masculinizes the male brain. In utero, that's true, but the way that cannabis seems to work, at least from the studies I was able to identify, is that it promotes circulating estrogen in the body and therefore can counteract some of the masculinizing effects of things like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone on primary and secondary sexual characteristics. So I mentioned this because, you know, I think nowadays marijuana use is far more widespread and certainly during puberty, it can have profound effects on these hormonal systems. And so we'll do another episode that goes really deep into this, but yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity by increasing aromatase. Most everyone can appreciate that drinking during pregnancy is not good for the developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a well-established negative outcome of pregnancy. And it's something that there are cognitive effects that are really bad. There's actually physical malformation, et cetera. So drinking during pregnancy, not good. Probably drinking during puberty, not good either because alcohol in particular, certain things like beer, but other grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, this isn't just about protecting young boys from estrogenic activity.",

So we are always tethered to the outside world to some degree or another. That was true when you were an infant and it was true when you were an adolescent and it's true as an adult. So now I want to just pause, just shelve the discussion about interoception, exteroception for a moment. And I want to talk about what is arguably the second most, if not equally important aspect of your development as it relates to emotionality. And as it relates to this, what I call trust, but this ability to predict whether or not things in the outside world are reliable or not reliable in terms of their ability to help you meet your interoceptive needs. And that period is puberty. So up until now, we've been talking mainly about psychology, not a lot of biology, not a lot of mechanism. And now we're going to transition into talking about mechanism, hormones, receptors, et cetera. Puberty is a absolute biological event.",

So it starts to become, you know become what we more map to the word aggression, which would be something negative in most cases. Like a desire or a tendency to harm. Sure, as aggressive drives get higher, which you see why they're in us, because let's say we're defending ourselves or you're defending a family member, right? Or like an entire family, right? Then it makes sense to have high levels of aggression if like your family is threatened, right? So those drives are in us with potentially those high levels for a reason, but we certainly access very high levels of aggression without the indication of preservation of life or preservation of safety. So the thought is that's a drive in us and that gets us up and off the ground, so to speak, right? And that the other drive then is pleasure, which again, doesn't just mean that like we all want to be hedonists, right? So pleasure could be even the pleasure of relief and safety, right? Like we're all back in the cave together and we roll the stone in front of the door.",

If there's a frustration of that, just like the person with the lower sex drive could talk about how frustrating it feels to feel pressured, right? So what are they developing? They're mentalizing, right? They're thinking about each other's emotional states and they're coming at each other through agency and gratitude. Like, I'm so grateful for you. The example is these people are partners and they're happy with their partnership. Like, oh my God, I'm so grateful I found you. They would each feel that way. I'm so grateful you're in my life.

So for 80 years, we've had this very kind of hyper-literal kind of model computers. Technically, these are what are called von Neumann machines based after the mathematician, John von Neumann. They run in that way. And they've been very successful and very important and our world has been shaped by them. But there was always this other idea out there, which is, okay, how about a completely different approach, which is based much more on how the human brain operates, or at least our kind of best understanding of how the human brain operates, right? Because those aren't the same thing. It basically says, okay, what if you could have a computer, instead of being hyper literal, what if you could have it actually be conceptual, right? And creative and able to synthesize information, right? And able to draw judgments and able to, you know, behave in, you know, in ways that are not deterministic, but are rather, you know, creative, right?",

In fact, they make no spontaneous movements unless there's something to respond to. And I find that incredibly relaxing. Other animals like pit bulls, who I also really like and enjoy, and other species, their tail's always wagging and that they're always in a position to make a movement at any second because they tend to ride at pretty high levels of autonomic arousal. They pop up really quickly when you say it's time to go for a walk. Costello does it one limb at a time, and sometimes he just goes back to sleep. And so there are people like that too. And so you have to know where you are and what particular goals you're trying to pursue. As a final closure to this, I want to emphasize that today, as always, I've strived to be accurate.

So we've talked about the role of music in evoking or shifting states of happiness and sadness. There are also interesting data that support the use of music for shifting one out of a state of heightened anxiety. And I find this especially interesting because my laboratory for a long time has worked on behavioral interventions to reduce anxiety, things like the physiological sigh, which if you're not familiar with, you can put physiological sigh and my last name into YouTube. And there's a demonstration of that. It's a breathing technique of two inhales through the nose and a long exhale through the mouth. The lungs empty that at this point in time, we understand to be the fastest and most effective way to reduce one's levels of anxiety in real time.",

So as you pointed out before, and I can only assume you were referring to me, hypertrophy training is idiot proof. Meaning there's a lot of leeway in the variables, but not so much leeway that people can do anything. It's bounded by these general principles. So with your permission, I'm going to do a brief overview of my notes based on your description of the modifiable variables that will direct somebody towards hypertrophy. Keeping in mind this backdrop of exercise choice, exercise order, selecting appropriate volume that sets and reps, training frequency, and needing some metric or way to have progression, either by adding more weight or by more tension or more metabolic stress and so on.",
        "KPlJcD-o-4Q_46": "Many people are familiar with dopamine from the concept of quote unquote dopamine hits, which is popular language describing the feeling of pleasure that we get from pretty much anything that we like or that we continue to engage in repeatedly. So some people will talk about the dopamine hit that they get from somebody attractive that they like texting them back or the dopamine hit that they get from social media or the dopamine hit that they get from sugar or the dopamine hit that they get from this or from that. To be honest, the concept of dopamine hits is not one that I favor because in general, whenever people talk about dopamine hits, typically they're talking about activities such as social media, which dopamine may be involved at some level, but often it's the case that the behavior associated with that thing, in this case, social media, is more of the compulsive nature rather than an active seeking of something with positive anticipation. And that's really what dopamine is about, at least in the context of one of its major functions in the brain. Dopamine is really about motivation and desire and movement. And it makes sense why motivation, desire, and movement would be linked up through a common, in this case, neuromodulator or chemical like dopamine.",

So I think that most people, including myself, hear the opioid crisis and assume that what we really should be doing is seeking a better alternative. But what I'm hearing from you is that there are use cases where opioids make a great deal of sense and that they've really helped improve people's lives and that none of what I just described or anything like it is experienced by those people. In fact, quite the opposite. Do I have that right? Perfectly. And that's, again, where we need to treat these at an individual level on a case-by-case basis and that one size doesn't fit all. Yes, opioids were overprescribed. I think everybody agrees to that in this country. And we went through a period of time with massive overprescribing, and there's a lot of nuance and reasons why, in large part, physicians, we get terrible education around pain, and we don't know how to treat it in general.",

So when I tell you, you know, not such great evidence for new neurons past puberty, that's what the data really show in humans. And I sort of knock back the data on exercise and neurogenesis. Don't let that depress you. If you have dementia in your family, don't translate that into a necessarily that you will develop dementia. Understand that exercise is still beneficial for the brain and other aspects of the nervous system, but that it's going to be doing it through these hormonal signals, things like IGF-1, things like this lactate pathway when you experience the burn from exercise. And again, you don't want to try and get this feeling of a burn throughout the entire episode of exercise. That would be far too intense and would inhibit your recovery.

It's like going from a old school dial-up connection or even an old school telephone connection or Morse code connection of communication to high-speed ethernet, okay, to a 5G connection. It gets faster, it gets more robust, and it's very, very clear. That's what happens when you get long-term potentiation. And long-term potentiation involves a couple of cellular mechanisms that are going to be relevant to our discussion about treatments to undo fear. And I'll just throw out a couple of the names of some of those cellular elements right now. The main one is the so-called NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.

That's incredible. Now, we also know from an extensive literature that the quality and perceived depth of a social bond correlates very strongly with how much physiological synchronization there is between individuals. In other words, when your bodies feel the same, you tend to feel more bonded to somebody else. And so this whole thing is a rather circular argument. When you feel closer to somebody else, your physiology synchronize. And the reverse is true as well. When your physiologies are synchronized, you feel closer to other people. This is what I call the concert phenomenon. If you ever go to see your favorite band or you go to a concert that you particularly love, you will often look over at somebody and you'll see them enjoying the same thing. And they're often in a similar state as you are. Maybe the sort of like favorite song comes on and you actually feel connected to that person. You feel like you're in, obviously there's a shared experience, but there's also a shared physiological response to that experience.",
        "dzOvi0Aa2EA_81": "The vagus nerve is generally associated with parasympathetic functions and has the capacity to slow down our heart rate, in particular by exhales. And just simply because of the movement of the diaphragm and its relationship to the heart and the thoracic cavity, exhales result in slowing down of the heart rate. This is what we call an increased vagal tone. So let me explain for a moment. And actually here's a tool you can use, not just in terms of navigating grief, but in terms of stress modulation, generally, we have a muscle called the diaphragm. When we inhale, whether or not it's through our mouth or nose, our diaphragm moves down. As a consequence, there is more space overall in the thoracic cavity. The heart gets a little bit bigger, believe it or not, volume-wise. Blood flows more slowly through that large volume, and there's a signal conveyed from the nervous system to the heart to speed the heart up. So inhales literally speed your heart up, and when you exhale, the diaphragm moves up. And as a consequence, there's less space in the thoracic cavity, heart gets a little bit smaller.",

So three sets of 30 seconds each, you get 90 seconds, and you would do that ideally five times a week, or maybe even more, because it does seem like frequency distributed throughout the week is an important parameter. Now, one thing that we have not highlighted or at least described is how long to rest between stretching sets. And despite my efforts, I could not find research back information that pointed to whether or not 30 seconds of rest for every 30 seconds stretching or 60 seconds rest for every 30 seconds stretching was ideal. I think it's reasonable to assume that doubling the amount of time for the interleaving rest would be appropriate or at least doable. If anyone out there has knowledge about rest between stretching sets and has some physiology or some biology or some experiential information as to why a given ratio of duration of static stretch to rest in between static stretch sets ought to be used.",

But in both of those particular journeys, the structure of the journey, who's present, who's not present, eyes open or eyes closed, the particular music that's played, all of those features make up part of a larger neuroplasticity trigger of which psilocybin is critical, but psilocybin is not the only variable.

So people could get very good at these tasks that you're kind of hard to imagine how they would translate to the real world for a non-Braille reader. But what it told us is that these maps of touch were very much available for plasticity. And these were fully adult subjects. They're not taking any specific drugs. They don't have any impairments that we're aware of. And what it showed, what it proved is that the adult brain is very plastic.

With regard to motor control, our mutual friend recently departed, Krishna Shenoy, was a giant in this field of motor prosthesis. It just so happens that his work was foundational for a lot of people that work in this area, including us, and he was an advisor to Neuralink. That work was farther along than most other work for addressing any function that lives on the surface of the brain.

Dr. Williams is a medical doctor and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine. His laboratory and clinic focus on depression and other mood disorders. They focus specifically on the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation, which is a brain stimulation technique that can either activate or quiet specific brain circuits, as well as circuits within the body, in order to treat depression and other mood disorders. Other laboratories and clinics use TMS. What sets apart the work of Nolan Williams and colleagues is that they combine TMS with other treatments. And some of those treatments are among the more cutting edge that you've probably heard about these days, including Ibogaine, psilocybin, MDMA, cannabis, DMT, and other drugs that at this point in time are experimental in terms of clinical trials, but that at least the preliminary data show hold great promise for the treatment of depression and other mood disorders.",

Everything is a potential interaction for them, and they have a very hard time restricting their behavior and their speech. So a lot of the motor system is designed to just work in a reflexive way. And then when we decide we want to learn something or do something or not do something, we have to engage in this top-down restriction. And it feels like agitation because it's accompanied by the release of a neuromodulator called norepinephrine, which in the body we call adrenaline, and it actually makes us feel agitated. So for those of you that are trying to learn something new or to learn to suppress your responses or be more deliberate and careful in your responses, that is going to feel challenging for a particular reason. It's going to feel challenging because the chemicals in your body that are released in association with that effort are designed to make you feel kind of agitated. That low-level tremor that sometimes people feel when they're really, really angry is actually a chemically induced low-level tremor. And it's the, what I call limbic friction.",

Whereas when you're in reflexive mode, just walking and talking and eating and doing your thing, it's going to feel very easy. And that's because your nervous system basically wired up to be able to do most things easily without much metabolic demand, without consuming much energy. But the moment you try and do something very specific, you're going to feel a sort of mental friction. It's going to be challenging. So we've got sensations, perceptions, and then we've got things that we call feelings slash emotions.

Basically, after I finish that cognitive work bout, that 90 minute work bout, I do some form of physical exercise for about an hour. The data all point to the fact that working out hard for longer than an hour can actually be detrimental because of the way that it raises cortisol and cortisol can be a good thing if it's appropriately timed and in the appropriate low levels, but you don't want to have your cortisol levels up throughout the day or have big spikes of cortisol repeatedly.

That's longitudinal study, the Harvard Happiness Project has reported, for instance, that people that are chronic smokers of nicotine and chronic consumers of alcohol, in particular alcoholics, that is people who suffer from alcoholism or what's sometimes called alcohol use disorder, that is strongly anti-correlated with happiness. And I should also mention that the family members and in particular, the romantic partners of people who are chronic smokers and the partners of people who are chronic alcohol users often will report lower levels of happiness, especially if they themselves are not chronic smokers or regular consumers of alcohol. So we've done episodes on nicotine in particular, and that touched on smoking, of course, and we've done an episode on alcohol and the effects of alcohol on health.",
        "3ZGItIAUQmI_73": "On that note, to whatever extent possible, I think Neuralink goes really, really far, much, much farther than anyone I've ever heard of, any organization I've ever heard of, anything I've ever seen to give the animals agency in every aspect of the research. We have just an incredible team of people looking out for the animals and trying to design the experiments such that they're as purely opt-in as humanly possible. No animal is ever compelled to participate in experiments beyond the surgery itself. So if, say, on a given day, our star monkey pager doesn't want to play video games for smoothie, no one forces him to ever. This is a very important point, and I want to cue people to really what Matt is saying here. Obviously, the animals are being researched on for neural links, so they don't get to opt in to opt out of the experiment. But what he's saying is that they play these games during which neural signals are measured from the brain because they have electrodes implanted in their brain through a surgery that thankfully to the brain is painless, right? No pain receptors in the brain and are playing for reward.",
        "uxZFl4BDOGk_61": "But anyway, an area that intrigues me because of this notion of hotheadedness or cool, calm and collected. And also the fact that, I probably should have asked about this earlier, that arousal itself is tethered to the whole mating and reproductive process. I mean, without a sort of seesawing back between the sympathetic and parasympathetic arousal relaxed states, there is no mating that will take place. So it's fascinating the way these different competing forces and seesaws operate. Several times during the discussion so far, we've hit on this idea that the same behavior can reflect different states and different states can converge on multiple behaviors as well. You had a paper not long ago about mounting behavior, which I found fascinating. Maybe you could tell us about that result because to me, it really speaks to the fact that mounting behavior can in one context be sexual and in another context actually be related to, we presume, dominance. And I think that my friends who practice jujitsu will say, when I talk about that result, they say, of course, mounting the other person and dominating them, there's nothing sexual about it.",

Again, this was known even by Ancel Keys, the guy who turned fat into the biggest boogeyman of all time. Ancel Keys acknowledged this in the 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role in serum cholesterol. Again, it took the American Heart Association another 60 years to figure that out, but even now they acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol has no bearing. So why is it that it's pretty easy to find studies or at least people with who are highly credentialed from good institutions claiming that eating saturated fat, saturated fat, red meat, things that are rich in cholesterol, to be more specific, is bad for us in terms of our eventual LDL. So this is two different things. So saturated fat consumption in many people will raise LDL cholesterol. So it's important to differentiate between the, what is saturated fat? So saturated fat, of course, is a fatty acid, just so people understand, totally different molecule from cholesterol. Cholesterol is this very complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together.",

Indeed, it dictates whether or not they can push to immediate milestones or whether or not they will think they have to overcome the entire task all at once. Basically, Dr. Balchettis' work has discovered that how we visualize a problem or a goal in our mind has everything to do with how we lean into that goal, whether or not we think of it as overwhelming or tractable, whether or not we think that we can overcome that goal and then it will lead to yet more possible rewards and goals, or whether or not we feel that we're going to arrive at the finish line and then just be overwhelmed with fatigue.",

The sativa varieties tend to make people feel a little bit less susceptible to pain and noxious stimuli, which are basically stimuli that you don't like. So the sativa varieties are often prescribed or are used in the recreational context for pain management and relief. Basically, the sativa variety is known to include a sort of head-biased effect. So here we're talking about subjective effects, and of course, these will vary from one individual to the next. Some people will smoke cannabis sativa or ingest cannabis sativa orally, and will feel an entirely different array of effects. But most people, the majority of people experience a sort of head centered, high alertness focus and a sense that they're more creative. Contrast that with the indica varieties of cannabis. And when people smoke or eat or ingest indica varieties, the psychoactive components of indica, and again, this is pure indica, so not hybridized with sativa at all, but just pure indica, tend to lead to more full-bodied effects.",
        "q8CHXefn7B4_128": "I'm really trying to get people out of the notion of active listening just because active listening has been so overused that people have lost track of it and most of it is taught poorly and it's interactive or it's proactive. And so we learned as hostage negotiators, first of all, just to label the presenting emotion. And we just assumed that, and the presenting emotion was always anger of some form, anger, upset. On certain rare instances, the guy was under control, but they were almost always negative emotions. So we just assumed that it was defined to what was confined to what was driving hostage takers was negativity. Now, if I may, because I feel like an imposter talking about neuroscience to you. Your knowledge of neuroscience is spot on, Voss. I must say, numerous times you've asked me about things in neuroscience, and you've never been off the mark. Oh, thank you. You've clearly done your homework, too. We keep trying to learn about it. But layman's terminology, the survival brain is largely negative. Ballpark, I would say 75% negative. Your reactions are going to be negative.",

And that's not the case. Okay, this is why we can reliably say physical real-world training, and again, this could be in the cognitive domain, is always going to be more effective on an hour-by-hour basis compared to mental training. So if you can do real-world training, and perhaps we should be calling it real-world as opposed to physical, but if you can do real-world training compared to purely mental training, that's going to be the best use of your time. This is really important. It doesn't underscore everything that we're talking about because here's the really cool thing. If you do 10 hours per week of real world physical training, again, it could be running, could be music, could be math, could be whatever it is you're trying to learn, shooting basketballs, hitting golf balls, and you add one hour or even half an hour of mental training to that real world training, well then the results are significantly greater than you would experience with physical training alone.",

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is Robert Green. Robert Green is an author who has written more than five best-selling books, including The 48 Laws of Power, The Laws of Human Nature, and Mastery. He did his bachelor's training at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Robert Greene's books are both unique and important for several reasons, not the least of which is that they explore the interaction between the psychology of self, self-exploration, and the psychology of human interaction, all rooted in history and modern culture, and at the same time, in a way that pertains to everybody. I first learned about Robert's work from reading the book Mastery, which to my mind is a brilliant exploration and a practical tool for how to think about and pursue one's purpose. Whenever I'm asked for book suggestions, I always include Mastery in my top three recommendations. During today's discussion, we cover a wide range of topics, including how to find and pursue and achieve one's purpose.",
        "PctD-ki8dCc_86": "I guess I think that it's a matter not of absolute control but more control, that we need to think of our brain as a tool and our body signals as tools as well to help us understand what's going on in the world, what matters, what's important, what isn't. But also something that can be managed, not simply absorbed. And so hypnosis, I think, is a kind of limiting case where you can push it about as far as we can push it in terms of regulating pain. Pain is a good example of that. Obviously, you need to pay attention. If you just broke your ankle, you better pay attention to it and get help. Or you're having crushing substernal chest pain, you better do something about it. But our brain is sort of programmed to treat all pain signals as if they were novel pain signals, if it's a sudden new problem that needs to be attended to. I teach people to think of the pain and categorize it. Does the pain mean that if you put weight on this, you're going to re-injure your ankle, for example? Or does it simply mean that your body is healing and the pain is a sign that gradually things are getting back to normal?",
        "p4ZfkezDTXQ_67": "Because I'm convinced, having spent some time thinking about this, writing about this, doing some journalism on this, talking to a lot of the experts, that I think where we're going to end up were all the arrows from the relevant social psych research, which I've been following this research since 2017. 2017 is roughly when you see the first warning signs going up that we need to worry about the potential mental health impacts of these tools, especially social media and smartphones, on young people. And you can track this, right? I have a talk I actually gave at my kid's school, I'm not happy about this, where I tracked how this research evolved. And, you know, like any literature, it's contentious at first, and then you begin to see conciliance between different lines of evidence. And I think where everything now in the last couple of years is starting to come together, this idea of we don't really know if this is bad or not, I think that's just an old take. The research has moved past that. And I think where we're landing on is unrestricted internet use pre-puberty is risky.",
        "gXvuJu1kt48_24": "So marijuana growers and people who specialize in creating novel varieties of the cannabis plant, again, I'm using the words cannabis and marijuana more or less interchangeably here. They are very good at creating new strains of plant that might be 25% sativa and 75% indica or vice versa, or 50-50 or 90-10. Essentially what's happening nowadays is that through plant biology, plant genetics, I should say, growers are getting quite efficient at creating a variety of different strains of the marijuana plant that give rise to very nuanced and distinct effects on brain and body. In fact, so much so that there's now a new nomenclature, a new language emerging around cannabis and the development of novel strains of cannabis for medicinal and or recreational purposes. And while this might sound a little bit medical or a little bit clinical to some people, believe it or not, this is the nomenclature that's now typically used. People still refer to the sativa, indica, and hybrid strains, but there's now also a description of so-called type one, type two, and type three strains for any given sativa, indica, or hybrid strain.",

But that's the mentality that I've embedded in myself, that there's nothing more important than what I'm doing in that 90 minute block. And that's what works for me. You can try various other things. That's what works for me. In addition, I use low level white noise. This is something that is supported by quality peer reviewed data. We covered this on the episode on hearing and balance, but it turns out that white noise, which is essentially all frequencies of sound, or all frequencies of sound that we can perceive, mixed up kind of randomly, there's no structure to it, turned on at a low volume, not with headphones most of the time, puts the brain into a state that's optimal for learning and workflow.",
        "uXs-zPc63kM_21": "And what we can know for sure is that at some point in human evolution, somebody or some group of people either, and here I'm completely guessing, it's a just so story, but someone or some group must have inhaled the smoke from the tobacco plant or put the dried leaves of the tobacco plant against some mucosal tissue, any of the different mucosal linings of their body by which substances can pass through. That's right. Any of the mucosal soft lining tissues of the body will allow certain substances, not all certain substances to pass in. That's why people can put tobacco in their mouth and a certain amount of nicotine makes it into the bloodstream. Put tobacco up their nose, certain amount of nicotine gets into the bloodstream. I haven't heard of people putting tobacco in other orifices of their body containing mucosal tissue, and I'm certainly not suggesting people do that, but you get the idea and how nicotine gets from these plants, these dried leaves into the bloodstream. Burning tobacco leads to a heat-induced change in the availability of nicotine. And this is why smoking tobacco or vaping tobacco simply by heating it up allows the nicotine to be liberated and go into the bloodstream simply by inhaling it into the lungs.",

Amygdala means almond. It's an almond-shaped structure on both sides of the brain. So you have one on the right side of your brain and one on the left side of your brain. The amygdala is part of what we can call the threat reflex. And this is very important to conceptualize fear as including a reflex. So much as you have reflexes that cause you to lift your foot up if you are to step on something sharp, you literally have a reflex within your spinal cord that causes you to lift up one foot and extend the other one toward the ground. Believe it or not, you always think that you step on something sharp, you pull your foot up, but you actually step on something sharp, you pull your foot up and in pulling it up, there's another reflex that's activated that as you extend your other leg so that you don't fall over.

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. This month, we're talking all about disorders of the mind, things like depression, attention deficit disorders, eating disorders, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. During the course of this month, we are going to discuss the psychological and biological underpinnings of mood disorders of all kinds. You'll learn a lot of science. You'll also learn a lot about the various treatments that exist and that are in development for these various mood disorders. We will talk about behavioral tools, things like exercise, meditation, breath work, but also prescription drugs, supplements, and novel compounds that are now being tested in various clinical trials. Across the month, I think you'll start to realize that there are common pathways underlying many mood disorders. In fact, mood disorders that look quite different from one another often depend on the action of the same neurochemicals or neural circuits in the brain and body.",
        "UF0nqolsNZc_125": "Well, in general, the answer is going to be no. However, if you're prone to epilepsy, for instance, staring at a flickering light of a given continuous frequency can induce seizure, right? That might surprise some of you, but it shouldn't because as this study illustrates, and as anyone who's ever been out at night to a club or something illustrates, when you look at a strobe light, for instance, your whole world of visual perception changes, but actually the rhythm at which you perceive music, at which you perceive conversation, at which you perceive the movement of your body actually changes according to the patterns of visual flicker, in most cases, strobe, if we're using the sort of club dancing example, your brain is in training to its outside environment. So given the power of flickering lights to entrain brain rhythms, I think at this stage, it's probably too preliminary to really suggest a specific protocol, but I would definitely keep an eye out for these sorts of studies. They are coming out all the time. And I think in a very short period, we're going to see specific protocols that one could potentially use even at home.",

You've talked about these personality traits of great innovators before, and we're talking about them now. You invest in innovators, you try and identify them, and you are one, so you can recognize these traits. Here, I'm making the presumption that you have these traits. Indeed, you do. We'll just get that out of the way. Have you observed people trying to feign these traits? And are there any specific questions or behaviors that are a giveaway that they're pretending to be the young Steve Jobs or that they're pretending to be the young Henry Ford. Pick your list of other names that qualify as authentic, legitimate innovators. We won't name names of people who have tried to disguise themselves as true innovators, but what are some of the litmus tests?",
        "KVjfFN89qvQ_37": "But it turns out that these neural circuits don't work that way, that to really activate these circuits for gratitude and the serotonin and probably the oxytocin system as well, and it's prefrontal networks, one has to powerfully associate with the idea of receiving help. The subjects are associating or experiencing empathy or sympathy for somebody else who received help. In the other study we described a few minutes ago, the person hearing the letter was receiving gratitude and that would amplify the activity of these circuits. And that takes us to a larger theme of what are these pro-social circuits? And an important concept to emerge from this is one that's most often associated with the autism literature, frankly, which is this idea of theory of mind. So just very briefly, theory of mind is the ability to attribute or to understand the experience of another without actually experiencing the thing that they're experiencing. Again, it kind of sounds like empathy, but this was actually a term that's now been demonstrated in the psychology and neuroscience that's been linked to some very robust findings associated with brain areas and so forth that was looking at autistic kids and non-autistic kids. The person largely responsible for developing theory of mind is Simon Baron Cohen.",

The generative drive is really what's the issue or the lack of generative drive in any of those conversations. It seems one could circle back to that and go, okay, well, someone's not asking the right questions and therefore not doing the right things because they don't either have a sense of agency or they don't have gratitude for the situation they're in, including their own ability to do that, right? So when you hear, you know, people aren't showing up for the relationship, they're not showing up or, you know, she's not showing up. Or again, let's make the pan statement go in the other direction that, you know, that somebody just wants a lot of attention, right? They just need an excess amount of attention. Won't let me do my own thing, but also wants me to work and be successful. You know, again, these are stereotypes, but all of that seems very distracting.",

That's how we can use the conscious mind and the narrative in order to foster self-awareness. It's not yet about meaning. It's about the awareness of an I. So it's actually much simpler than I'm making it out to be at some level. At that level, yes. Got it. Yes. Okay, well, then at some point we will return to this theme of narratives, narratives that serve us, perhaps narratives that don't serve us.

If you are really interested in these drugs and how they work, and you'd like to get a glance at a table of all the results from all the studies of which there are now hundreds, there's an excellent review about these drugs and their use and their comparison to similarly structured drugs, in particular MDMA and cocaine and amphetamine, meaning street amphetamine, to really illustrate the similarities of action and some of the problems associated with long-term use. I don't expect you to read this article in full. I'm here so that you don't have to go read these articles, but in case you want a ton of information, the paper is Esposito et al.

        "6ZrlsVx85ek_57": "Some people experience a little bit more pain than others, but it's not considered a very painful procedure. It is, however, a procedure that can cause some bleeding of the scalp, and that bleeding of the scalp can be very apparent, especially if it's in the front of the head, as opposed to in the top of the head and hidden by some hair, or if you're already quite bald in a given region. So keep that in mind. I suppose one could wear a hat or a wig or something of that sort if they were really self-conscious about it. But the microneedling itself is causing a physical disruption to the scalp, some degree of bleeding, inflammation. And again, all of that is part of the process by which microneedling can actually improve hair growth. And of course, there's healing that occurs of the bleeding and the damage to the follicle. This is a transient thing, but understanding the cosmetic implications in the short term, as well as in the long term, is certainly worth knowing. One thing that's very clear is that the combination of microneedling and minoxidil treatment together is far more effective than either of those treatments alone.",
        "H-XfCl-HpRM_45": "And also I want to make sure that I pay attention to the fact that for many of you, you're thinking about neuroplasticity, not just in changing your nervous system to add something new, but to also get rid of things that you don't like, right? That you want to forget bad experiences or at least remove the emotional contingency of a bad relationship or a bad relationship to some thing or some person or some event. Learning to fear certain things less, to eliminate a phobia, to erase a trauma. The memories themselves don't get erased. I'm sorry to say that the memories don't themselves get erased, but the emotional load of memories can be reduced. And there are a number of different ways that that can happen, but they all require this thing that we're calling neuroplasticity. We're going to have a large number of discussions about neuroplasticity in depth, but the most important thing to understand is that it is indeed a two-phase process. What governs the transition between alert and focused and these deep rest and deep sleep states is a system in our brain and body, a certain aspect of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system. And it is immensely important to understand how this autonomic nervous system works.",

In other words, I feel like I can do more work without feeling so exhausted, and I feel as if I'm recovering from my workouts more quickly, in particular across the day after my workouts. In fact, if I had to cite one specific subjective effect that I've experienced from taking rhodiola rosea before very high intensity workouts is that prior to taking it, I would often find that three or four hours after the workout, having eaten a good meal, taking a shower, et cetera, and I was tired. I have a real dip in energy. But now I notice I have a lot of energy throughout the day, even after these very high intensity sessions in the early part of the day. And frankly, I haven't changed anything else about my supplementation or my nutrition, at least nothing major. So I personally am going to continue to take rhodiola rosea before these high intensity workouts.",

I do want to use this as an opportunity to raise something about the so-called Uberman schedule, not to be confused with the Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one has confused those yet. Some years ago, there was a discussion about the so-called Uberman schedule, meaning the Superman schedule. So that's Huberman without an H, which I have nothing to do with. If you read your Nietzsche, this will have a subtext. But regardless, the Uberman schedule, as I understand, is one in which the person elects to sleep in 90-minute bouts spread throughout the day and night in an attempt to get more productivity and or reduce their overall sleep need. There was a paper published recently that explored whether or not this is good or bad for us. Maybe you just give us the take-home message on that. Yeah, so these Uberman-like schedules, and there's lots of different forms of that.",
        "ObtW353d5i0_33": "Now, here's another reason to do this, and I've never spoken about this before on any podcast, which is that there have been several studies now in thousands of subjects exploring what can be done to prevent myopia, nearsightedness, and other visual defects. And it turns out in a series of large clinical trials, the conclusion has emerged that getting two hours a day of outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light, this blue light that everyone has demonized, getting that sunlight during the day for two hours, even if you're reading other things and doing other things outside, has a significant effect on reducing the probability that you will get myopia, nearsightedness. Now, whether or not that's also due to the fact that myopia can be caused by viewing things up close too much. So if you're indoors, we tend to be looking at things more closely, right? Unless you have a very large house with walls that are very far away from you. But the effect does seem to be directly related to getting sunlight and not just to the distance that you're viewing. I'm going to describe this study just briefly, but this is a second protocol.",

Typically when cortisol is high, testosterone tends to be lower and vice versa. So we don't know what's causing these effects. And again, this is just one study and just six occupations, but I think it's relatively interesting given the fact that each of these professions involves different levels of competitiveness, right? So we don't necessarily just want to think about the level of physical exertion that's required, but also the level of competitiveness because it's known that competitive interactions can cause increases in testosterone, in particular in the winners of competitive interactions, a topic for a future podcast. Meanwhile, studies that have analyzed also again, salivary testosterone in prisoners, in this case, female prisoners, so these are incarcerated individuals, have looked at levels of testosterone according to whether or not the person committed a nonviolent or a violent crime in order to arrive in prison and higher levels of salivary testosterone were related to those that had arrived in prison because of conviction of a violent crime as opposed to a nonviolent crime.",

We also discuss the topics of motivation and urgency, and this concept of death ground, which arose during our discussion of Robert's recent stroke. Robert's stroke rendered him certain limitations, but also has allowed him to explore how to write, how to exercise, indeed, how to interface with life in general in new ways that allow him to continue to expand his sense of purpose. I'm certain that by the end of today's episode, you will have gleaned tremendous amounts of new knowledge that will allow you to navigate forward along the path to your purpose, perhaps find your purpose if you feel you haven't done that yet, as well as to greatly enhance your relationship with yourself, with others, and indeed to the world around you. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Roka.",

And the cooling group basically left all other groups in the dust. It was just remarkable. So cooling the core, I want to be very clear that it's not cooling the muscle. It wasn't about cooling the chest alone or just cooling the palms. It was about allowing cold to pass through the palms because of the unique vasculature that's there, these AVAs, allowed these subjects to do far more work per unit time. And the important thing is that if they were to come back after doing 600 pull-ups or 500 pull-ups, you might say, well, wow, that's going to create a situation where recovery is going to be absolutely impossible. They could come back, not use the cooling, and they still saw a highly significant increase in the amount or the number of pull-ups or dips or bench press weight that they could do, okay? So what that meant is that it was both an excellent performance and an excellent training stimulus that they were able to recover from, okay?",
        "x7qbJeRxWGw_27": "People who are trying to increase thyroid levels might want to consume more selenium. And if you consume a vitamin, of course, you want to make sure if it has selenium, that you're not overdoing it by consuming a lot of selenium rich foods either. But nonetheless, I think it's fair to say that most people probably could do well by ingesting slightly more selenium than they currently are. Although of course, always talk to your doctor. Brazil nuts are the heavyweight champion of foods to get selenium from. It has very high concentrations of selenium. In just six or eight, Brazil nuts contain something like 550 micrograms of selenium. It's also present in fish. So certain fish like yellowfin tuna, although nowadays, whenever I mentioned tuna or shellfish, which is the other rich source of selenium, people will tell me immediately there are all sorts of issues around farm, not farm, mercury, et cetera. So I've never particularly liked eating fish because of the way it tastes. So that's why I avoid it. But for those of you that like it, I'm sure you're much more skilled in knowing which fish to buy and which fish not to buy.",
        "EhlIkzJwPlk_15": "I don't want to cause myself to run out of eggs earlier or going to menopause earlier. And it's explaining this process to them that your ovaries are on a pathway that you can't change. Those eggs are coming out of the vault, regardless of if you're on birth control pills, you're pregnant, we do IVF. What we're modifying is one's not going to ovulate and have the rest of them die. We're going to try to give you medication to get them all to grow so we can take all of the ones that have been released from the vault that month and give them a chance for later. And the next month, you'll have another group come out. So IVF is not about stimulating hyper-release or excessive release of eggs. It's about stimulating the growth of the ones that have been released so that they can be frozen at stage either for later fertilization or fertilized in addition than frozen as embryos. Is that right? Exactly. And we just use the hormones that your body normally makes in a different way. The medications we use are FSH and LH to get the eggs to grow.",
        "VQLU7gpk_X8_65": "It's about these muscles' ability to generate a lot of force in the short term, but repeatedly, okay? So that's the way to conceptualize this. And it is different than maximum power, even though it feels like maximum effort, it is not the same as building power and speed into muscles. Those are distinctly different protocols. So the key elements again, are that you're bringing your breathing and your oxygen utilization way up above your max. It's not quite hitting failure, but you're really pushing the system to the point where you are not ready to do another set and yet you begin another set. You're not necessarily psychologically ready. I'll talk more about some of the adaptations that this causes in terms of stroke volume in a few minutes when we talk about how it is that work of this sort can increase our heart's ability to deliver blood and oxygen to our lungs and other tissues. I'm going to get very specific about how to breathe during these different types of protocols and what's happening at the level of the heart. But I want to make sure I touch on the fourth protocol, which is high-intensity aerobic conditioning. So HIT has these two forms, anaerobic and aerobic, and you just heard about anaerobic.",
        "wTBSGgbIvsY_42": "So I asked you to ask yourself whether or not you are somebody who tends to be more interoceptively aware or not, more exteroceptively aware or not. And some of you might not be able to answer that question. And if you can't, chances are that you are effectively sliding along that continuum, depending on the activities that you're doing. So you're probably the kind of person where if somebody comes over to you and starts talking to you, you will engage in that conversation and you don't feel so inside your body that you're thinking about your heart beating and whether or not you're flushing red, et cetera, you're going to pay attention to what they say. Many people, however, when somebody talks to them, if they have social anxiety or even a slight bit of social anxiety, will be thinking about whether or not their cheeks are flushing or whether or not they look right or sound right or whether or not they have something in their teeth. These are normal responses, but they really speak to this issue of whether or not you tend to shift more towards interoceptive awareness or exteroceptive awareness. And of course it's context dependent.",

If you like, and if you feel you have the ability, you can try and do this through covert attention and focus by looking straightforward, for instance, and attending to something in the corner of the room and trying to do that for 30 seconds. You'll find that that's quite a bit harder. And then extending that by five seconds every time you do the practice. This is something that I don't think you necessarily have to build up to being able to do for a full hour in order to extract the benefits. In fact, the best way to think about this practice is as a means to get into a focused state. If you remember back about an hour or so ago, I was talking about how focus states are not a drop all the way in and then exit type phenomenon. We don't just drop into a focus state the same way we don't drop into the peak performance of a workout. We warm up.",

They still can't stop themselves. So they're sort of as made aware as could possibly be. Did I use grammar there correctly? I think so. They're as aware as they could possibly be, and they still lose control. We've had this studied in the lab. So we will bring patients to the laboratory with this implanted device to try to provoke this electrographic electrical signal that can be detected by the actual device that will stimulate them when they're at home. But before we actually initiate stimulation, we want to see, can this device detect this craving cell signal, which is going to be different than what we saw in the operating room because that's a single cell. But these devices, these electrodes are about a millimeter in diameter instead of like a tenth of a millimeter, which is what we use in the operating room. So they're only hearing or detecting, I should say, thousands of cells' responses. And we actually have a way to provoke binges. It's called a mood provocation.",
        "zVCaYyUWWSw_20": "Keep that in mind. I think it's a very important point. Now, another key point is that next to your teeth, right, you have your gums, the gingiva, as's called. Now the gingiva provides a really important role in keeping the teeth stable. We don't often think of it like that, but even though that stuff seems gummy and soft, it is soft tissue. It is very important for fixing the teeth to the bone. It's not just about the roots that extend down into the jawbone below. The gums are very important for keeping the teeth where they are. There's actually a little ligament too, between gums and the teeth that resides a little bit deeper, but the gums form a critical barrier between the oral cavity and the deeper layers of what eventually is bone and into the general blood flow or bloodstream of the body. Now, this is so important to understand that the gums are a seal around the tooth. This is why when you go to the dentist, they're paying attention with that little pick.",
        "6ZrlsVx85ek_2": "Now that discrepancy illustrates for us just how incredible hair follicles and the stem cells that reside within hairs are, and their enormous potential to give rise to these things that we call hairs, which are simply proteins, of varying length. So today we are going to address what determines the length of a hair or rather what determines how long a hair continues to grow before it ceases growing and eventually falls out. We're going to talk about what regulates those stem cells, what allows them to continue to produce hair or cease producing hair. And as we do that, you will learn all the biology in clear, simple terms, regardless of your background, that will really set the stage for understanding what we'll also talk about, which is how to slow hair loss or halt hair loss entirely, or even reverse hair loss. So we will talk about hormone-related hair loss in both men and women. We will talk about some of the mechanical and stress-related influences on hair loss. And we will talk about the chemical and mechanical approaches to halting and reversing hair loss. Everything from minoxidil to dutasteride to ketoconazole to microneedling to thyroid, estrogen, IGF-1 pathways.",
        "uxZFl4BDOGk_49": "I think there are some experiments where people have tried to, classical experiments, people have tried to reproduce the changes in hormones that occur during pregnancy in female rats to see if it can make them aggressive. And some of those manipulations do to some extent, but there's a whole biology there that remains to be explored about how much of this is hormones, how much of this is circuitry and electricity, and how much of it is other factors that we haven't identified yet? I don't want to anthropomorphize, but well, I'll just ask the question. So the other day I was watching ferrets mate, right? They're mustelids and they're mating behavior. I guess I didn't say why I was watching this. It doesn't matter. It simply doesn't matter. But if one observes the mating behaviors of different animals, we know that there's a tremendous range of mating behaviors in humans. There can be no aggressive component. There could be aggressive component in humans that have all sorts of kinks and fetishes and behaviors, and most of which probably has never been documented because most of this happens in private.",
        "doupx8SAs5Y_129": "So if you were to ask me what has changed significantly since the time that you wrote The 4-Hour Body, I would say that rather than looking for areas to optimize, I am looking where I can very deliberately de-optimize certain areas to increase sense of well-being. Where can I de-optimize? Where can I stop measuring? Where can I stop reading books? Which areas can I ignore completely? What types of information can I just excise from my life altogether for a period of time? Delete Twitter. Stop reading about books in X related to say AI or whatever it might be. Like where can I de-optimize selectively to sort of optimize the whole? Does that make sense? Makes good sense. Yeah. And before we started recording, I gave you a book, which is a short collection of poetry by Halaliza Ghaffouri, which is called Gold. It's a collection of Rumi poetry. Reading poetry is an activity almost by definition, which is the antithesis of optimization. So I've tried to also integrate more of those activities into my life.",
        "J7SrAEacyf8_55": "So how does that work? Well, DHT circulates in the body and it binds to DHT receptors in the face to promote hair growth, but it binds to DHT receptors on the scalp to promote hair loss. Not incidentally, the drugs that are designed to prevent hair loss are 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. So remember 5-alpha reductase from the huevidosis? Well, the people that discovered the huevidosis went on to do a lot of research on the underlying biochemistry of this really interesting molecule, dihydrotestosterone, the identified 5-alpha reductase. And 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are the basis of most of the anti-hair loss treatments that are out there. And so there are some interesting things here. First of all, the side effect profiles of those treatments for hair loss are quite severe in many individuals.",

It actually triggers neuroplasticity. You probably never forget that because of the way that dopamine gates plasticity. When we get a surprise of something that we didn't want, also it creates plasticity. So the surprise, novelty, motivation, and reward, they're all woven into this package that we call dopamine. And the cool thing is you can actually regulate this whole system in a way that will steer you or lean you towards more positive anticipation of things in life and less disappointment. It's simply a matter of adjusting what we call the dopamine schedule. Okay, a couple of things before we continue. We're going to talk about attention deficit in a few minutes, but before that, I want to talk about something that I've mentioned before on previous podcasts, but that you may not be aware of. And if you're aware of, you may still be doing, which is severely injuring your ability to release dopamine.",
        "2XGREPnlI8U_86": "What's amazing, frankly also important are these findings that once you teach anorexics what's happening to them, that they're doing this, they are able to intervene. Now they need support, right? And another form of therapy that seems to work well for anorexics that ideally is combined with this habit rewiring is a family-based model. Family-based models are starting to surface a lot now in various therapy settings. Therapy-based models, in short, are basically where the entire family is made aware of the individual's challenges with a particular eating disorder or other disorder. And in understanding some of the biology and psychology around it, they stop condemning the individual. They start to support that individual through cueing them towards their own habits that they observe. They give them some autonomy. They realize that none of this changes overnight, but they're taught about things like neuroplasticity and the ability to change one's brain in response to experience. And so there's a whole internal support network. Now, for people that live alone, this isn't available to them. This isn't the kind of thing that you share with your coworkers.",

InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and reach your health goals. I've long been a fan of getting blood work done for the simple reason that many of the things that impact our immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. And now with the advent of modern DNA tests, we can also get insight into things like metabolic factors that tell us whether or not we metabolize caffeine well or certain proteins well, what our fat metabolism genes are like. Things of that sort can only be analyzed from quality blood and DNA tests.",
        "qNzl12g0Dd8_35": "And so we are consuming, I think, unhealthy levels of sugar in our diet. We're consuming a fair amount of additives given the processed food composition in our diet. And I think part of the reason this is happening, and I want to be very clear, I don't fault individuals out there for the composition of their diet necessarily because we have also made certain decisions in our country about what we subsidize, about what's cheaper and more expensive for people. And the cheapest foods, unfortunately, are often the most unhealthy foods, the most highly processed foods. If you are somebody who lives in a low-income neighborhood, a number of these neighborhoods don't even have grocery stores in them, which is a tragedy because you can't get fresh produce, etc. A lot of times your grocery shopping may be done at a local convenience store, at a 7-Eleven or somewhere else that may not have the array of fresh fruits and vegetables that you and your family need. I don't even think they have vegetables. I think they'll occasionally have some lemons or apples or oranges or bananas. But when I walk into a convenience store, what I see is a pharmacy.",
        "Mwz8JprPeMc_18": "Now, before you run off with your interpretations about what this means and criticize the study for any variety of reasons, let's just take a step back. I will criticize the study for a variety of reasons. Two, one is that they only used female tears and male subjects. So it would have been nice for them to also use female tears and female subjects smelling those, male tears and male subjects smelling those, male tears and female subjects smelling those and so on. They didn't do that. They did have a large number of subjects, so that's good. That adds power to the study. And they did have to collect these tears by having the women watch what was essentially a sad scene from a movie. They actually recruited subjects that had a high propensity for crying at sad movies, which was not all women. It turns out that the people that they recruited for the study were people who said, yes, I tend to cry when I see sad things in movies. What they were really trying to do is just get tears that were authentically cried in response to sadness, as opposed to putting some irritant in the eye and collecting tears that were evoked by something else, like just having the eyes irritated.",
        "Nr5xb-QCBGA_42": "We've learned that if you expose them to food like that, within two weeks, their nucleus accumbens is not functioning like a mouse that was never exposed to that high fat food. There's aspects of it that are hyperactive, I could say, and there's aspects of it that are hypoactive or decreased activity. But either way, it's not functioning properly. And most likely that function is predisposing continued behavior. And then probably eventually leads to things like a habit that gets developed. And that's a whole nother area of these kinds of problems that is very complicated and poorly understood. But in any case, if we just focus on the behavior at hand, it seems that repeated exposure to something like high fat food, a drug of abuse, or any type of reward that is a really strong reward, in a way it can hijack normal functioning of the nucleus accumbens. So the goal of our invasive trial is to try to restore normal functioning to that nucleus accumbens. In mice, there seems to be a signal that predicts when they're going to lose control. And we can use that signal to deliver a sort of a real-time therapy in the form of deep brain stimulation, just a brief amount of stimulation.",
        "RBK5KLA5Jjg_10": "It's a form of sadness that's amplified and it shows up as aggression. But when we look at the underlying biology and the peer reviewed literature on this, nothing could be further from the truth. We have distinct circuits in the brain for aggression versus grief and mourning. Those are non-overlapping. Now that doesn't mean that you can't be sad and aggressive or in a state of mourning and aggressive at the same time. But the idea that sadness and aggression are one in the same thing is simply not true. And by understanding that, or perhaps by understanding that irritability and aggression are not the same thing, you'll be in a much better position to apply some of the tools that we will talk about in this episode in order to be able to reduce or eliminate, or if it's adaptive to you to modulate aggression. And yes, there are cases where modulating your aggression in some cases, even amplifying aggression can be adaptive. Now, this of course is not the first discussion about the biology of aggression or the psychology of aggression. And we really can look to the beginning of the last century as the time in which the formal study of aggression really began.",

Again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens, go to million people as to what their major goals were in working out, they'd say, as you so nicely listed out before, aesthetic changes, functionality, and longevity. But that one in three really kind of sit higher than most people would like to perhaps even admit. They want to look good, which usually means they want to lose some fat, gain some muscle in specific places. I realize there are folks out there who want to gain a lot of muscle and just muscle everywhere. But I think most people would like to have a little more shape here, a little more muscle there to either balance out their aesthetic or to accentuate certain parts of their physique. And they would probably like to shave off some subcutaneous fat. Although there are those exceptionally lean people out there and they exist too. I think it would be gain muscle in specific places, lose fat and do it in a way that also provides some boost to their health span and longevity. I would say that that might even be 50% of people out there.",
        "tLRCS48Ens4_36": "These are the probes, whereas the psychiatrist or psychologist uses words and language to probe. Yes. So what are the sorts of aspects of character structure that we can be aware of in ourselves? You know, I mean. In other words, should we be asking what type of character do I have, dependent on one circumstance or another? Should we ask ourselves what sorts of defenses we have? And maybe this would be a good opportunity to address this issue of what are healthy versus unhealthy defenses? Because it sounds to me, if I understand correctly, that the defense mechanisms are a very strong component in determining what our character structure is. Because the defense mechanisms are unconscious. The character structure that nests around the defenses in the conscious mind through which we interface with the world is very, very complicated. So there are as many character structures as there are human beings. So it's very, very complicated. But there are factors that are consistently relevant across people and get identified as such. So one example would be isolation versus affiliation. So does a person tend to group with others, right? Or does the person tend to avoid grouping, right?",
        "K-TW2Chpz4k_34": "That's the kind of first grade version of reward prediction error. It's also taking into account all the things that happen in between. And all of that is serving as a cue for the eventual reward. And all of that is funneling into what we call reward prediction error. In other words, the dopamine system is very good at subconsciously parsing what are the things that happen between wanting and getting. And that's part of the learning that dopamine achieves. And indeed, there are specialized circuits from the VTA and nucleus accumbens that are involved in just the learning of how we achieve or don't achieve specific types of rewards that we desire. So this is called reward contingent learning because it's learning the contingencies of what led up to a reward or what didn't lead up to a reward. At the same time and in parallel, there's an ongoing release of dopamine in the background. And that ongoing release of dopamine that has nothing to do with learning is really just sort of a propeller that's driving us in the direction of whatever it is that we're trying to pursue. So I realize for some of you, this might seem like unnecessary or perhaps even an overwhelming amount of detail, but it's actually quite simple.",
        "aXvDEmo6uS4_79": "For those that have lower than desired levels of testosterone or too much sex hormone-binding globulin, it turns out that 400 milligrams per day of something called Tongkat Ali, which is a form of ginseng, can actually help increase levels of free testosterone. Many people experience a positive subjective effect and some objective effects as well, meaning increases in free testosterone when they do blood analysis. There are some data on that, not a ton in the peer-reviewed literatures. And again, always approach these with a sense of caution and definitely talk to your doctor. If you want to learn more about that, you can go to examine.com. There's a lot of information there listed about that. The other compound that's relevant both to men and women, or I should say people that are trying to optimize testosterone and or estrogen is Fidogia. Fidogia agrestis is actually an herb that increases the levels of what's called luteinizing hormone. Luteinizing hormone is a hormone that's released from the hypothalamus within the brain that travels to the gonads, either the ovaries or the testes, to stimulate the release of estrogen or testosterone.",
        "Wcs2PFz5q6g_9": "But as many of you are well aware, there are popular books about habits and there's a whole psychological literature about habits. And those two areas point to some very interesting aspects of habits that I think are worth mentioning. First of all, is this notion of immediate goal-based habits versus identity-based habits. Immediate goal-based habits are going to be habits that are designed to bring you a specific outcome as you do them. So each and every time you do them. So for instance, it might be that you want to develop a habit of getting, you know, 60 minutes of zone two cardio each day, or perhaps, you know, three, four times a week as we head into the new year. I've talked before on the podcast about the fact that the scientific literature and the health literature really points to the incredibly positive effects of getting 150 minutes to 180 minutes per week minimum of what's called zone two cardio. Zone two cardio is basically any cardiovascular exercise that gets you moving and your heart pumping and breathing, but not so hard that you can't hold a conversation.",
        "qJXKhu5UZwk_61": "And I'm sure as I say that, you're probably thinking, oh, of course. In summer, when there's more sunlight, days are longer, nights are shorter, in general, it tends to be warmer out. And in winter, when nights are longer, days are shorter, it tends to be colder out. And in the winter months, testosterone and estrogen tend to be lower in many animals and in humans. And in the summer months, because of the role of dopamine in promoting the sex steroid hormones, when days are longer and it's warmer, humans tend to make more estrogen and testosterone relative to the other months of the year. Now, these effects can be somewhat weak and modulated as opposed to in seasonally breathing animals where they're really dramatic, okay? But the point is that temperature and day length and sunlight, those are all intimately related because of the systems that we evolved in, right? So before we had artificial light and artificial heating and artificial cooling, our biology evolved under systems where temperature, day length, and the hormones were correlated with one another. So nowadays there's a lot of interest in using cold as a way to stimulate testosterone.",
        "OadokY8fcAA_12": "That is an astonishingly high number. Now, the reason the range is so big, 2.5% all the way up to three or maybe even 4% is that a lot of the features of OCD go unnoticed both in the clinician's office and simply because people don't report it and don't talk about it. In fact, it is possible to have recurrent and intrusive obsessions and not engage in the sorts of behaviors that would ever allow people to notice that somebody has OCD. That can be because some of the intrusive thoughts don't actually lead to overt behaviors like hand-washing or checking that other people would notice. It can also be because people learn to disguise or hide their obsessions and their compulsions out of shame or fear of looking strange or whatever it might be, such that they have these obsessive and intrusive thoughts and they do little micro behaviors. Like they might tap their fingers on their thigh as a way to avoid, at least in their own mind, something catastrophic happening. That might seem crazy to you. It might seem bizarre, but this is the sort of thing that operates in a lot of people.",
        "juD99_sPWGU_135": "And then other little tricks that I've learned over the years is one particular thing I love is literally drawing a line, a physical line on the ground. And you look at that line and you say, I'm going to train today and I'm going to accomplish this effort. I'm not going to walk past this line and into that training space until I'm ready to give that effort. And that may take a minute or 10 or whatever. But the physical barrier is very important to saying, like, I'm not just going to get through it. I'm going to actually perform the way I want to perform, or I'm not going to do it, and I'm not going to cross this line until I'm ready to make that happen. I really like that tool. It also brings to mind the importance of at least thinking about how your relationship with your phone during training can perhaps help, but also impede workout motivation and performance.",
        "Xu1FMCxoEFc_32": "One idea is that the SSRIs actually can improve symptoms of depression or even remove symptoms of depression through so-called neuroplasticity by changing the way that neural circuits function. And there are many studies on this, but the main categories of studies on SSRIs that relate to neuroplasticity fall into two camps. One is that the ways in which SSRIs might, and I want to emphasize might, be able to trigger the production of more neurons in the brain, in particular areas of the hippocampus called the dentate gyrus and others that impact memory. This is important. We're going to come back to memory. The other is that the SSRIs have been shown in various scientific studies to reopen critical periods of plasticity. I'll just briefly describe one of those studies. It was a study done by Lamberto Maffei's group in Pisa that explored brain plasticity that's known to be present in young animals and disappear in older animals. And this is also true in humans. The younger humans have a far more plastic brain. It can change in many more ways more easily than can the older brain.",
        "aXvDEmo6uS4_93": "I walk the dog again, that's my protocol in order to get that evening light. What it does is it lowers the sensitivity of your retina in the late evening hours, which allows you to buffer yourself against the negative effects of bright light later at night. Now, it won't allow you to blast your eyes with bright light. You still need to dim the lights in the evening, but there's a very nice study that was published in Scientific Reports that illustrates that if one does this, if you go outside and view sunlight in the evening hours for anywhere from five to 30 minutes, and I realize that people have a range of constraints on their schedule, but from five to 30 minutes, what happens is that your melatonin rhythm stays appropriate. Now, we haven't talked too much about melatonin, but melatonin is a hormone that is inhibited by light. It's actually prevented by light. And melatonin is the hormone that allows you to fall asleep easily. Now I'm not talking about supplementing melatonin. I'm talking about melatonin that you naturally produce from your pineal. So the protocol is very simple.",
        "oNkDA2F7CjM_1": "So in order to kick things off, I'd love for you to frame the conversation by telling us what is endurance and are there indeed a large variety of ways to induce what we have a bunch of misnomers here, which is the same thing with the strength training or resistance exercise side, where we wanted to dispel this myth that I lift weights only because I want to gain muscle or play a sport. And I want to do cardio because I want to either lose fat or for long health sake. And just like we smashed that myth from the strength training side, I want to smash it from the endurance training side. There are so many other reasons that you want to perform endurance training, regardless of your goal, right? Whether it is longevity, whether it is performance, or whether it is aesthetics. And so I want to cover all those reasons, exactly what to do, protocols, of course, and why those things are working that way. In general, though, the quick answer is really endurance comes down to two independent factors. Factor number one is fatigue management. And then factor number two is fueling. And that's all it really comes down to.",
        "HXzTbCEqCJc_1": "Buss's laboratory has also evaluated how status is assessed, meaning how we evaluate our own worth and our potential as a mate and who is, let's just say, within range of a potential mate, both in the short and long term. For instance, today we talk about how people don't just make direct assessments of their own and other people's value as a potential mate, but also using the assessments of others to indirectly determine whether or not they stand a chance or not in securing somebody as a short or long-term mate. His laboratory has also focused on some of the complicated and varied emotions related to mating love in relationships, such as lust and jealousy. And he's extensively explored something called mate poaching or the various strategies that men and women use to make sure that the person that they want to be with or the person they are with is not with anyone else or seeking anyone else. And indeed that other people don't seek their mate. Dr. Buss's work also relates to how biological influences such as ovulation or time within the menstrual cycle influences mate selection or tendency to have sex or not with a potential short or long-term mate. And more recent work from Dr.",
        "szqPAPKE5tQ_15": "And of course he remembered all this meaningless information, but even though the information might've been meaningless, the experiment itself and what Ebbinghaus demonstrated was immensely meaningful because what it said was that with repetition, we can activate particular sequences of neurons and that repeated activation lays down what we call a memory. And that might all seem like a big duh, but prior to Ebbinghaus, none of that was known. Now I should also say Ebbinghaus, because of when he was alive, was not aware of these things that we call neural circuits. It was in 1906 that Golgi and Cajal got the Nobel prize for actually showing that neurons are independent cells connected by synapses, these little gaps between them where they communicate. So he may have been aware of that, but the whole notion of neural circuits hadn't really come about. Nevertheless, what the Ebbinghaus learning curves really established was that sheer repetition, just repeating things over and over and over again is sufficient to learn. Something that no doubt had been observed before, but it had never been formally quantified. Now, if we look at that result, there's something really important that lies a little bit cryptic.",
        "CDUetQMKM6g_1": "And that turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg in terms of how our parents' experiences and our experiences can be passed on from one generation to the next, both in terms of modifying the biological circuits of the brain and body and the psychological consequences of those biological changes. During today's episode, Dr. Rahavi gives us a beautiful description of how genetics work. So even if you don't have a background in biology or science, by the end of today's episode, you will understand the core elements of genetics and the genetic passage of traits from one generation to the next. In addition, he makes it clear how certain experiences can indeed modify our genes such that they are passed from our parents to us and even transgenerationally across multi-generations. That is, one generation could experience something and their grandchildren would still have genetic modifications that reflect those prior experiences of their grandparents. Dr. Rahavi takes us on an incredible journey explaining how our genes and different patterns of inheritance shape our experience of life and who we are. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.",
        "F54qXuTpgfM_93": "So in terms of orgasm, right, I think it's important to distinguish that there is orgasm and then there's different areas that you stimulate to achieve orgasm. So some people will stimulate, the clitoris is probably the most reliable form of stimulation that will achieve orgasm. And when you look at the data, and again, female sexual dysfunction data is not super robust, but what we find is that about 85% of women require clitoral stimulation in order to climax. So very few actually climax through just vaginal penetration alone. And so this is a real problem we're seeing on the media that you have sex and you penetrate and immediately women are having orgasms. That's not the reality for a lot of women. And in terms of stimulation, so like we've talked about throughout this podcast, the clitoris is the homologue of the penis or the penis is the homologue of the clitoris, however you want to say it. Good on you for getting it both directions. I probably would have screwed that one up. So clitoral stimulation is just like penile stimulation for women. That is very reliable. And there's a huge orgasm gap.",
        "m_OazsImOiI_117": "And when we think of a disorder, we think of something that is really detrimental to us, something that really impairs our ability to function in work and school and relationships and really starts to pull down our health status in a variety of ways. And certainly bipolar disorder meets those criteria. However, there is this idea that things like bipolar disorder, even things like schizophrenia in some cases, are responsible for some of the creative aspects or the creative works that have been observed and carried out by human beings for many centuries. And believe it or not, there are good data to support the fact that certain aspects of mania are associated with creativity. Now, we are long overdue for an episode about creativity, its neural circuit basis, its chemical basis here on the Huberman Lab Podcast. And certainly we will have that conversation. But in the meantime, I'd like to just briefly touch upon this idea that certain occupations are associated with a higher incidence of bipolar depression. And in fact, it's been explored at a research level."
